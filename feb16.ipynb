    "1. SQL uses table structure to store data which is already defined, i.e SQL databases are structured,Whereas  NoSQL databases are unstructures they can store such as key-value format,document or graphs.\n",
    "2. NoSQL are highly scalable i.e they can handle large amount of data easily than SQL.\n",
    "3. In SQL all nodes in the database will have the same view of the data at all times. on other hand  in NoSQL invidual nodes may have slightly different views of the data in some situations.\n",
    "5. SQL is used where data must be in well structured and consistant.NoSQL is used when data need to be highly scalable and flexible "
