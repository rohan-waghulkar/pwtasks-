    "1. Cetroid based clustering : It works by assigning the datapoint to a centroid. k-means clustering is the type of centroid based clustering algorithm\n",
    "2. Density based Algorithm : It works by identifying high dense region of the data and grouping it as a cluster.DBSCAN is a example of density based clustering.\n",
    "3. Hierarchical clustering: Hierarchical clustering algorithms work by building a hierarchy of clusters, where each cluster is nested within a larger cluster. Hierarchical clustering algorithms can be used to identify both coarse-grained and fine-grained clusters in the data, but they can be difficult to interpret and can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n"
