    "- GridSearchCV is a techique used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for the model.Hyperparameters are the parameters that controls the learning rate of a model.\n",
    "- GridSearchCV apply every possible combinations of the parameters to the model and find out the parameters that performs well. And these parameters are selected as optimal Hyperparameter.\n",
    "#### Here's how grid search CV works:\n",
    "- Define the Hyperparameter Space: First, you specify the hyperparameters and their possible values that you want to tune.\n",
    "- Create the Grid: Grid search CV creates a Cartesian product of all possible hyperparameter combinations from the defined hyperparameter space.\n",
    "- Cross-Validation: For each hyperparameter combination, the algorithm performs k-fold cross-validation on the training data.\n",
    "- Model Evaluation: After completing k-fold cross-validation for a particular hyperparameter combination, the performance metric (such as accuracy, F1 score, or mean squared error) is computed for the model.\n",
    "- Select Best Hyperparameters: Once all hyperparameter combinations are evaluated, grid search CV selects the combination that produced the best performance metric. "

    "- Both GridsearchCV and RandomizeSearchCV are the techniques used in machine learning to find the optimal hyperparameter.Here are some key difference between GridsearchCV and RandomizeSearchCV\n",
    "#### Grid Search CV\n",
    "- Grid Search CV try all the passible combination of hyperparameter and select the combination that performs well.\n",
    "- as Grid Search CV try all the passible combination of hyperparameter the process becomes computationally expensive and time consuming.\n",

    "- unlike Grid Search CV Randomize Search CV Ramdomly samples the subset of parameter. and evaluates the model's performance on each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- it is a less time cosuming technique as compare to Grid Search CV\n",
    "- because it has selected random parameters there are chances that best parameter are not been selected \n",
    "- it has high risk of overfitting \n",
    "#### Here are some additional considerations when choosing between grid search CV and randomized search CV:\n",
    "- The size of the hyperparameter space: If the hyperparameter space is small, then grid search CV may be a good option. However, if the hyperparameter space is large, then randomized search CV may be a better option.\n",
    "- The computational resources available: If you have a lot of computational resources available, then grid search CV may be a good option. However, if you are short on computational resources, then randomized search CV may be a better option.\n",
    "- The risk of overfitting: If you are concerned about overfitting, then grid search CV may be a better option. This is because grid search CV is more likely to find the optimal hyperparameters, which can help to reduce overfitting."
