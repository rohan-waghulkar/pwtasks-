    "#### Lasso regression is different from other regression techniques in a few ways:\n",
    "- it uses a different penalty function. Other regression techniques, such as ridge regression, penalize the sum of the squared coefficients. This means that the coefficients are shrunk towards zero, but they are not as likely to be set to zero as they are in lasso regression.\n",
    "- Second, lasso regression can be used for feature selection. Because some of the coefficients may be set to zero, lasso regression can identify the most important features for the model. This can be useful for reducing the complexity of the model and making it easier to interpret.\n"

    "#### Here's how you can interpret the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign of the coefficient: The sign of a coefficient in Lasso Regression indicates the direction of the relationship between the corresponding predictor variable and the target variable. A positive coefficient suggests a positive relationship, meaning that an increase in the predictor variable leads to an increase in the target variable, while a negative coefficient suggests an inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Magnitude of the coefficient: The magnitude of a coefficient in Lasso Regression indicates the strength of the relationship between the predictor variable and the target variable. Larger magnitude coefficients indicate a stronger impact on the target variable compared to smaller magnitude coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Zero coefficients: One of the distinctive features of Lasso Regression is that it can drive the coefficients of irrelevant or less important features exactly to zero. A zero coefficient means that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model and is not contributing to the prediction. These zero coefficients enable automatic feature selection, indicating that the corresponding predictors have been deemed unimportant or redundant by the Lasso Regression algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity: Lasso Regression promotes sparsity by driving coefficients towards zero. The sparsity property means that only a subset of features has non-zero coefficients, while the rest of the coefficients are exactly zero. This sparsity makes the selected features easier to interpret, as it helps identify the most important predictors in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative magnitudes: When comparing the magnitudes of the coefficients within the same Lasso Regression model, it is meaningful to assess the relative importance of the predictors. Larger magnitude coefficients generally indicate stronger relationships with the target variable, while smaller magnitude coefficients suggest relatively weaker relationships."

    "- alpha (α), is a hyperparameter that you can adjust to control the amount of shrinkage applied to the model coefficients. A larger value of alpha results in stronger regularization, leading to more coefficients being pushed to zero, effectively reducing the number of features used in the model. Conversely, a smaller value of alpha reduces the amount of regularization, allowing more features to have non-zero coefficients and potentially leading to a more complex model.\n",
    "#### The impact of the regularization strength on the model's performance can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Larger Alpha: When alpha is large, the model tends to become simpler by discarding many features, effectively performing feature selection. This can be beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional data and when there are many irrelevant or redundant features. However, if alpha is too large, the model may oversimplify and underfit the data, leading to decreased predictive performance.\n",

    "- Smaller Alpha: A smaller alpha allows the model to include more features, potentially capturing more complex patterns in the data. This can be advantageous when dealing with data that contains many important features. However, if alpha is too small or close to zero, the regularization effect diminishes, and the model can become prone to overfitting the training data."

The data is divided into several folds, and the model is trained on subsets of the data while validating on the remaining fold.
